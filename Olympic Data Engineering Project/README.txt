Azure ETL Data Pipeline Project
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline built on the Microsoft Azure platform. The goal is to process large-scale data effectively by leveraging Azureâ€™s ecosystem for data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analytics. This project serves as a practical showcase of cloud-based data engineering skills and an understanding of modern ETL workflows.

Project Architecture
The ETL pipeline consists of the following stages:

Data Ingestion:
Azure Data Factory connects to an external API, extracting raw data and loading it into Azure Data Lake Storage.
Data Transformation:

Azure Databricks is used to write and execute Apache Spark code to cleanse, filter, and transform the data. The processed data is then stored in Azure Data Lake Storage.
Data Analysis:

Azure Synapse Analytics provides a platform for running SQL queries and conducting in-depth analysis of the processed data.
Data Visualization:

Visualization tools, such as Power BI, connect to Synapse Analytics, enabling interactive dashboards and reports for stakeholders.
Key Components
Azure Data Factory: Automates data ingestion and movement within the pipeline.
Azure Data Lake Storage: Stores both raw and transformed data, supporting structured and unstructured data.
Azure Databricks: Performs data transformation with scalable Spark computing power.
Azure Synapse Analytics: Provides a unified experience for data analysis and exploration.
Power BI: Delivers insights through visualization, making data accessible for decision-making.
Project Highlights
End-to-End Cloud Integration: Implements a complete data pipeline using Azure services, showcasing skills in cloud-based data engineering.
Scalable Architecture: Built to accommodate large datasets and scalable for future growth.
Optimized Data Processing: Uses Apache Spark in Azure Databricks to process data efficiently.
Real-time Insights: Data is processed and transformed in near real-time, making insights immediately available for analysis
